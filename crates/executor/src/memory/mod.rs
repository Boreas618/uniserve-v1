//! The main process's resident memory (`specs/worker.md` §4 `MainProcess.memory`).
//!
//! Resident memory is device storage the epoch keeps until it retires: the KV
//! cache planes, the latent pages, the products of cross-call tensors, the
//! request slots, the retained weights and the encoder cache. Every one of
//! them is an exclusive storage at the host's Storage Server, keyed by the
//! inputs `crate::keys` composes, so a restarted main process of the same
//! scope and epoch maps what its predecessor left instead of loading it
//! again.
